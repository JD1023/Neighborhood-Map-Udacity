# Neighborhood Map Project

This is the final Project for the Udacity Front-end Developers Nanodegree.

This is an app written using react and shows Restaurants I would like to visit when I tour Amsterdam.
Locations can be filtered and markers can be clicked on to display more information about the locations.

This application was bootstrapped with Create react app: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
Color themes are from https://color.adobe.com/explore


## Live Demo

Developer Demo is hosted on https://neighborhoodmap--jd1023.repl.co/

## Getting Started
Download and install nodejs if it isn't already installed, then
download or clone this repository and open your console in the project's root directory and run the following commands:
```
	> npm install
	> npm start
```
Your default browser window will open and display the application in developer mode with no service worker.

For Production with service worker run:
```
    >npm install
    >npm run build
    >npm serve -s build
```

Then open your favorite browser and go to localhost:5000
